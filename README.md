## Potential Applications
- **Surveillance**: Enhance security measures by identifying and tracking objects in surveillance videos.
- **Video Analysis**: Conduct in-depth analysis of video content for various purposes such as research, marketing, or content curation.
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Implement object recognition for advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles.
- **Industrial Automation**: Integrate the system into manufacturing processes to automate quality control or object tracking.
- **Custom Applications**: Use the repository as a base for developing custom applications that require video object recognition.

Feel free to explore the repository and contribute to this exciting project!
